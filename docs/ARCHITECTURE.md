# Architecture

This document walks the JS-native game machine block by block and says where
each block lives in the Python Functional Model. Every block on the
(eventual) diagram should have exactly one module; every module corresponds to
a block. That correspondence is the point — SystemVerilog is a translation,
not a redesign.

**Constitution:** [../CONSTITUTION.md](../CONSTITUTION.md) wins on conflict.
**Board / HDMI / input freeze:** [FPGA_BRINGUP.md](FPGA_BRINGUP.md).

## The idea

A conventional computer executes assembly (or a soft CPU), and a runtime /
browser implements JavaScript:

```
CPU  ->  browser / VM  ->  JavaScript
```

This machine reverses that. JS source becomes compact bytecode; bytecode *is*
the machine code:

```
JavaScript  ->  bytecode  ->  processor (microcode + engines)
```

There is no hidden general-purpose core underneath. **No dukpy/V8/browser as
the machine.** V1 is a **Canvas game computer** (HTML titles → JMR bytecode).

```
NAME.HTML  →  RUN always compiles  →  fresh .JSH  →  bytecode VM + engines
```

User types only `LOAD "NAME.HTML"` / `RUN`. Chrome may open the same file for
authoring; PYTHON / FPGA-SIM / BOARD / ASIC must run the **JMR VM**.
Not a general HTML/CSS browser in V1.

## High level view (V1)

          Framebuffers (V1: dual 640×480 BRAM; DDR3 later)
```

Also: String, Event/Timer, Storage, Audio (later) — separate engines, shared
where reuse is honest. **No general CSS engine in V1.**

## Instruction flow (target)

| Step | Meaning | FM home (when present) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Fetch next bytecode / work unit | Program sequencer |
| 2 | Decode | Dispatch table |
| 3 | Load microcode entry | Microcode ROM |
| 4 | Execute micro-ops (drive engines) | Micro-sequencer |
| 5 | Complete statement / task | Sequencer outcome |

Stalls (e.g. waiting for input, blitter, or a timer) are pipeline stalls, not
host blocks. Compile/parse may take many cycles — that is intentional.

---

## What is deliberately not here

- **No hidden CPU.** Nothing evaluates JS by calling into V8 / QuickJS / a soft core.
- **No merged engines.** Expression, heap, Canvas, blitter, video stay separate.
- **No BASIC token tables.** This is not a re-skinned BASIC machine.
- **No Nexys A7-100T assumptions.** Primary board is **Nexys Video** (XC7A200T);
  wiring owned by `FPGA_BRINGUP.md`. PA-StarLite is a later port.
- **No V1 general CSS / full browser.** Canvas + minimal HTML game container.

## BRAM / LUT policy

Prefer BRAM for palette, microcode, FIFOs, font, line buffers, bounded stacks.
**V1 game FB (FPGA-SIM / next bit):** native dual **640×480** in `jmr_mini_fb.sv`
BRAM — not DDR3 yet. Constitution still wants heaps / full FB in external DDR3
later; the 03:36 flashed bit was still 160×120 scaled. Do not invent LUT counts
from that mix. Live chip totals: [FPGA_FIT.md](FPGA_FIT.md).

## FM → RTL correspondence

As modules land, keep a table here: diagram block → `functional_model/…` →
`rtl/…`. Folds must be documented (same rule as the BASIC sibling method).

| Diagram block | Functional Model | RTL |
|---|---|---|
| Console / Machine | `functional_model/machine.py` | `rtl/engines/jmr_console_engine.sv` |
| INPUT / keyboard | FIFO + `ps2_decode` path | `jmr_keyboard_fifo` + `ps2_rx`/`ps2_decode` (board: J15 dead → PROG tether) |
| INPUT / play keys | GUI KEYBITS | `jmr_uart_link` `0xFE` → `joy_in` (SIM + board tether) |
| INPUT / joystick | `functional_model/input_engine.py` | `rtl/engines/jmr_input_engine.sv` |
| Canvas / FB | `functional_model/canvas_engine.py` | `jmr_mini_fb.sv` native **640×480** dual-buffer BRAM (SIM; next bit) |
| One-glass letterbox | `CanvasEngine.paint_console_letterbox` | `jmr_text_hdmi_scanout.sv` + dual-clock `jmr_video_vram` |
| Bytecode VM | `functional_model/bytecode.py` + `jsb_format.py` | `rtl/engines/jmr_js_vm.sv` (writable BRAM + FAT `.JSH`) |
| Storage | `functional_model/storage_engine.py` | `storage_engine.sv` + SD SPI + console load |

**Honest path:** product titles are `*.HTML`. **`RUN` always compiles** the
loaded HTML into the **JMR bytecode VM** (fresh internal `.JSH` output) on
PYTHON, FPGA-SIM, BOARD, ASIC. Never prefer a stale `.JSH`. dukpy is a
**cheat / debt** if used as the game engine. Never call dukpy “FPGA-SIM.”
User never types `.JSH` — only `LOAD "NAME.HTML"` / `RUN`.
